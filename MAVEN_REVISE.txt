Maven is an automation project management tool.
It is used to build the code
once we build the code we will get JAR/WAR/EAR
Maven is used to add the dependencies to our application.
Maven is based on POM.xml
to convert to sourcecode into an application, we build it and hundreds of files will become single file& exxtension of it will be war or jar or ear
(JAVA)WAR - web archive file,(JAVA+SPRINGBOOT) JAR - java archive file,(J2EE) EAR - enterprise archive file and python inbuilt, .net MSbuild, nodejs NPM

MAVEN LIFECYCLE:
1. generate the resource(code, tools install)
2. compile the code
3. unit test
4. pack the code
5. install and then deploy (manual)
6. clean

dependency- java-1.8.0-openjdk (realtime standard version)
yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk -y
yum install maven -y
mvn archetype:generate  ---> pom.xml,src folder
we perform goals in maven in the same folder where pom.xml file is present
mvn compile (to compile the code) -> we get target folder 
mvn test
mvn package
mvn install
mvn clean
mvn clean package

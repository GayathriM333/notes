Questions:
--------
Daily tasks: fixpack upgrades and tomcat version upgrades. Involved in major activities like lift and shift migrations for WAS applications. WAS set up for the application from the scratch. creating Datasources,deploying through jenkins or manual.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day to Day activities, issues which we face regularly, logs, Fixpack & issues& log file to check, Tomcat upgrade issues, WAS ND, horizontal and vertical scaling, cluster creations, Datasource creation and JDBC drivers which we use, SSL, Security, all the files like resource.xml, serverindex.xml, variables.xml, soap.client.props etc. 
profiles, default port numbers, WAS-IHS integration i.e, plugin & what is present in Plugin file. what is swap, important linux cmds, disable security console, virtual host&context root, TLS & ciphers, diff btw tls and ssl.(on way ssl and 2 way ssl) 
WAS installations, node federation- after federation what could be the reason for nodeagent not starting?
security repositories, heap and thread dump analyzer.SSL handshake error.
https to http migration. java jdk migration, ibm http and apache upgrade. three-tier architecture, log4j, vulnerability names, proxy-reverse proxy, app scan remediations, loadmodule ibm_ssl_module.cron jobs, automatic restarts, decommisions, WAS config backup, FFDC, application architecture,session affinity, cell & nodes& Nodeagent(managed and unmanaged node), sesssion timeout, httpd.conf file, how to change loglevel, class loader all.class are stored, how does app server knows DB connected, DR activity,log rotation, connection pool, web container,
-how many ways you can deploy the application in WebSphere
-Master repository
request flow, how to send traffic to only one server(change jvm_weight=0 and comment that server in plugin file

Here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide for integrating applications into IBM WebSphere Application Server (WAS), based on reliable sources and best practices:

üîß 1. Prepare Your Environment
Install WebSphere Application Server (WAS): Ensure WAS is installed and running.
Install IBM HTTP Server (optional): For front-end web server integration.
Install WebSphere Plugins: Required if integrating with IBM HTTP Server 1.
üìÅ 2. Create an Application Server
Open the WebSphere Admin Console.
Navigate to:
Servers ‚Üí Server Types ‚Üí WebSphere Application Servers.
Click New to create a new server.
Provide a server name, select a node, and configure ports.
Click Next, review the summary, and click Finish.
Save the configuration.
üì¶ 3. Deploy Your Application
In the Admin Console, go to:
Applications ‚Üí Install New Application.
Choose the EAR, WAR, or JAR file to deploy.
Select the deployment target (server or cluster).
Configure context root, class loading, and JNDI bindings as needed.
Click Finish and Save the configuration.
Start the application from the Enterprise Applications section.
üîÑ 4. Configure Resources
JDBC Providers & Data Sources:
Resources ‚Üí JDBC ‚Üí JDBC Providers ‚Üí Add new.
JMS Resources:
Resources ‚Üí JMS ‚Üí Configure connection factories and destinations.
Environment Entries:
Resources ‚Üí Environment ‚Üí Environment Entries.
üîê 5. Security Configuration (Optional)
Enable Global Security:
Security ‚Üí Global Security.
Configure LDAP or File-based user registry.
Assign roles and permissions to users/groups.
üåê 6. Integrate with IBM HTTP Server (Optional)
Install WebSphere Plugins on the HTTP Server.
Configure httpd.conf to load the plugin.
Use the Plugin Configuration Tool to generate plugin-cfg.xml.
Restart both servers.

Step-by-Step Application Integration in WebSphere Application Server
1. Start the Admin Console
Open the WebSphere Integrated Solutions Console (usually at http://<hostname>:9060/ibm/console).
Log in with administrative credentials.
2. Create an Application Server (if needed)
Navigate to:
Servers ‚Üí Server Types ‚Üí WebSphere Application Servers.
Click New.
Enter a server name, select a node, and configure ports.
Click Next, then Finish, and Save the configuration.
3. Install the Application
Go to:
Applications ‚Üí Install New Application.
Choose the EAR, WAR, or JAR file to deploy.
Select the deployment target (server or cluster).
Configure:
Context root (e.g., /myApp)
Class loading policy
JNDI bindings (if needed)
Click Next, review settings, then Finish and Save.
4. Configure Application Resources
JDBC (Database):
Resources ‚Üí JDBC ‚Üí JDBC Providers ‚Üí Add.
Create Data Source and test connection.
JMS (Messaging):
Resources ‚Üí JMS ‚Üí Add connection factories and destinations.
Environment Variables:
Resources ‚Üí Environment ‚Üí Environment Entries.
5. Start the Application
Go to:
Applications ‚Üí Enterprise Applications.
Select your app ‚Üí Click Start.
6. Test the Application
Access via browser:
http://<hostname>:<port>/<context-root>
Check logs:
SystemOut.log and SystemErr.log for errors.
7. Optional: Integrate with IBM HTTP Server
Install WebSphere Plugins.
Configure httpd.conf to load the plugin.
Generate plugin-cfg.xml using the Plugin Configuration Tool.
Restart both WAS and IHS
